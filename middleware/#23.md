### Question

How much data do your services have access to? All of it? Or only what they need?

### Answer

In microservice practice, split monolithic database into small ones helps us to improve data security in some parts.  Basically service only talks to services on requirement and their own resources, the database belongs to the other services is invisible to the caller, and there's no reason to access that for business progress.

You can use database credentials to prevent the other services to access the database, but it's not enough from the theory of defense in depth, we often introduce infrastructure level ACL to control the others irrelevant client can't start connection to that database.
