### Question

Does the rest of your system trust your gateway services too much?

### Answer

In simple, if your internal service needs to talk to the gateway, you should only trust the gateway and have strong ACL rules or the other policies to apply the trust relationship otherwise the gateway should be invisible to the rest services.

It's similar to the least privilege principle, we build the trust relationship only necessary.  This methodology guides us to manage our system, every requirement of resources are on-demand, and the resources must be provisioning, to reduce the cost of management we practiced as-code, all these functions support the application available, reliable and secure.
