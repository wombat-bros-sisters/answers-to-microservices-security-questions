### Question

If you need to upgrade your password storage algorithm, how do you do that without mass disruption to your users?

### Answer

The challenge often is we don't save the password in plain text in our database (If you are doing this, please refer this [post](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm) to replace the plain text password as soon as possible), we do have passwords which are protected by some weak algorithm, we want to upgrade it but we don't want the user to reset it. 

The first solution is we consider the old hashed password as the plaintext input for new storage algorithm, the good point is it's easy to operate, you can create a new table and have some background job to convert it, and when the new algorithm is working in our code, we switch it.  This solution is simple and easy to practice when you are building a new authentication system especially.  But the bad point is you must have some tech debt because then you can't get rid of the old algorithm in your code.

Another thought is we let the user trigger the password migration, it happens when the user is login or reset the password because at that time we could have the plain text password then we use the new algorithm to storage it.  Once a day most users finish the migration, we could retire the old algorithm and reset the password for the people who didn't trigger our migration.  The drawback is obvious, the migration will take a long time and a few people they need to process "forget password?".
